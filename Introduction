The Bank Management System is a desktop-based application developed in Python using the Tkinter GUI toolkit and MySQL as the backend database.
It is designed to automate and simplify the fundamental banking operations performed by bank administrators, such as managing customer accounts, processing transactions, updating account information, and generating reports.

This system provides a user-friendly interface that allows the administrator to efficiently handle banking activities like account creation, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and account closure — all in real-time.
The main goal is to provide a lightweight, secure, and easy-to-use tool that can manage and store customer financial data with accuracy and reliability.
